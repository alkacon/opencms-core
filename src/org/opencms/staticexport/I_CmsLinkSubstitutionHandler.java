/**
 * Allows to configure customized link substitution behavior.<p>
 *
 * Using this handler, you can completely customize the behavior of the link substitution.<p>
 *  
 * This handler is plugged into 
 * {@link CmsLinkManager#substituteLink(org.opencms.file.CmsObject, String, String, boolean)},
 * which is the central method to calculate links from VFS paths,
 * used by the <code>&lt;cms:link /&gt;</code> tag and the rest of the OpenCms core.<p> 
 *
 * Moreover, this handler is plugged into 
 * {@link CmsLinkManager#getRootPath(CmsObject, String, String)},
 * which is the reverse method to calculate a VFS root path from a link.<p>
 * 
 * For any implementation of this interface you must ensure the following:
 * <pre>
 *     // path: String that represents a valid VFS resource root path
 *     // cms:  a valid OpenCms user context
 *     String httpLink = OpenCms.getLinkManager().substituteLinkForRootPath(cms, path);
 *     String vfsPath = OpenCms.getLinkManager().getRootPath(cms, httpLink);
 *     path.equals(vfsPath); // this must be true!
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The default implementation of this interface is {@link CmsDefaultLinkSubstitutionHandler}.<p>
 * 
 * @since 7.0.2
 * 
 * @see CmsLinkManager#substituteLink(org.opencms.file.CmsObject, String, String, boolean) 
 *      for the method where this handler is used to create a link from a VFS root path
 * @see CmsLinkManager#getRootPath(CmsObject, String, String)
 *      for the method where this handler is used to create VFS root path from a link
