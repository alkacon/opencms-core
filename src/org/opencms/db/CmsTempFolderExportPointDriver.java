/**
 * An alternative export point driver which replaces the RFS targets of some export points with locations in a temporary export folder.
 *
 * This is designed specifically for export points which map to WEB-INF/lib and WEB-INF/classes. The problem with these is that replacing
 * jar files or classes does not work at runtime. If these files are written to a temp folder (which is not picked up by the servlet coontainer's
 * class loader) instead, an external script can be used to update the actual export point locations based on the temp folder while the servlet
 * container is stopped.
 *
 * Since the script needs to know which files to delete in the 'real' (not temporary) export point locations, deletions of files which are mapped
 * to the temp export point folder are not handled by deleting the files in that folder, but rather by replacing them with "dummy" files containing
 * a specific marker string (which is contained in the DELETE_MARKER variable), so the script that updates the 'real' folder needs to delete files
 * if it comes across a file starting with that marker string.
