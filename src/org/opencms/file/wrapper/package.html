This package contains classes and interfaces used to access OpenCms through a wrapped 
{@link org.opencms.file.CmsObject}.<p>

Main entry point is the class {@link org.opencms.file.wrapper.CmsObjectWrapper}. The 
<code>CmsObjectWrapper</code> is configured with a list of implementations
of {@link org.opencms.file.wrapper.I_CmsResourceWrapper}. So it is possible to show resources in 
the VFS different as usual.<p>

For example: If you would like that xml pages always have the correct file extension (.xml) so you
can use the {@link org.opencms.file.wrapper.CmsResourceExtensionWrapperXmlPage}. This implementation
of the interface <code>I_CmsResourceWrapper</code> adds to every resource of type
"xmlpage" the correct file extension ".xml".<p>

This package is mainly used by {@link org.opencms.repository.CmsRepositorySession} to create a 
simple configurable access to the resources in OpenCms.<p>
