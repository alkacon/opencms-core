/**
 * Describes an OpenCms request handler.<p>
 *
 * Request handlers are used for special requests to OpenCms
 * that should NOT be mapped to a VFS resource.
 * A request handler URI always start with <code>/handle</code> and then
 * one or more possible handler names as defined with the {@link #getHandlerNames()}
 * method.<p>
 *
 * For example, if a registerd request handler has the name <code>"MyName"</code>,
 * any request (in a simple setup) to <code>/opencms/opencms/handlerMyName...</code> will directly be transfered
 * to the {@link #handle(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, String)} method of this
 * handler.<p>
 *
 * In essence, the request handlers are like simplified mini-servlets that run inside OpenCms.
 * Of course they are not intended as replacements for real servlets.
 * In case you require sophisticated lifecycle support use a genuine servlet instead.<p>
 *
 * @since 6.0.0
