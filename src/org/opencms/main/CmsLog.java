/**
 * Provides the OpenCms logging mechanism.<p>
 * 
 * The OpenCms logging mechanism is based on Apache Commons Logging. 
 * However, log4j is shipped with OpenCms and assumed to be used as default logging mechanism.
 * Since apparently Commons Logging may cause issues in more complex classloader scenarios,
 * we may switch the logging interface to log4j <code>UGLI</code> once the final release is available.<p>
 * 
 * The log4j configuration file shipped with OpenCms is located 
 * in <code>${opencms.WEB-INF}/classes/log4j.properties</code>. OpenCms will auto-configure itself 
 * to write it's log file to <code>${opencms.WEB-INF}/logs/opencms.log</code>. This default behaviour
 * can be supressed by either using a log4j configuration file from another location, or by setting the
 * special property <code>${opencms.set.logfile}</code> in the log4j configuration file to <code>false</code>. 
 * 
 * @since 6.0.0
