Provides the main OpenCms "operating system".<p>

There are 3 main ways to access resources in an OpenCms System:
<ol>
<li>Using the <code>{@link org.opencms.main.OpenCmsServlet}</code>. This is the default usage of the OpenCms system.</li>
<li>Using the <code>{@link org.opencms.main.CmsShell}</code>. This is done for specific reasons, usually related to system configuration or setup.</li>
<li>Using the <code>{@link org.opencms.main.OpenCms#initCmsObject(String)}</code> from an application to obtain an initialized OpenCms user context.</li>
</ol>

I all use cases, the access to the OpenCms VFS is only possible with an initialized OpenCms user context,
this means by using a <code>{@link org.opencms.file.CmsObject}</code>.<p>
