Classes to implement page content storage functionality using XML.<p>

Pages are containers for "unstructured content", which is maintained in the form 
of separate HTML elements that can be edited in OpenCms using a WYSIWYG editor.
HTML elements of pages can also be saved in various localized versions 
for multilanguage support.<p>

The validity of the XML data is maintained using a XML schema.<p>
