The implementation of the OpenCms JSP tag library, with some additional utility classes to
help in JSP scriplet code and navigation building.<p>

Most of the classes in this package implement the <code>&lt;cms:&gt;</code> taglib.
To access the exact same functionality using scriptlets, obtain an instance
of a <code>{@link org.opencms.jsp.CmsJspActionElement}</code> from the current JSP.
Using the action element you can also access the current users OpenCms context 
in a <code>{@link org.opencms.file.CmsObject}</code>, by using <code>{@link org.opencms.jsp.CmsJspBean#getCmsObject()}</code>.<p>

To aid in template navigation building, have a look at the
<code>{@link org.opencms.jsp.CmsJspNavBuilder}</code> which provides a large selection of methods 
to easily create dynamic navigations.<p>
