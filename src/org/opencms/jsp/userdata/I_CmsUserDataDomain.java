/**
 * Interface for user data domains.<p>
 *
 * A user data domain can provide information about users which have requested their user data.
 * Several user data domains can be configured in opencms-system.xml. When requesting information,
 * there are two types of scenarios:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The user requests data with his email address.
 * <li>The user requests data with his user name and password.
 * </ul>
 *
 * In the first case, more than one user can match the email address, in the second case at most one user is found.
 * For each of the users, they will be matched against each of the user data domains (a user can match more than one domain).
 * Then the domain produces the user data for the list of matching users by appending it to an HTML document.
