# One of the most important uses is e.g. replacement of space with "_".
# So if a user uploads a file "my file.txt" the name will be translated to "my_file.txt".
# All of the translation rules are applied to the filename in the given order.
#
# By setting the "enabled" attibute to "false" you can disable filename translation.
# It is enabled by default. It's recommended to leave this enabled.
#
# Filename translation is only applied to: 
#   - File uploads (the name of the uploaded file is translated)
#   - Zip-File uploads (all filenames in the Zip are translated)
