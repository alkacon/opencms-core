<!--
# Filename translation is used when creating new files to automatically 
# replace chars not allowed in the OpenCms VFS into allowed ones.
# This is done using Perl5 regular search & replace expression translation rules.
# One of the most important uses is e.g. replacement of space with "_".
# So if a user uploads a file "my file.txt" the name will be translated to "my_file.txt".
# All of the translation rules are applied to the filename in the given order.
#
# By setting the "enabled" attibute to "false" you can disable filename translation.
# It is enabled by default. It's recommended to leave this enabled.
#
# Filename translation is only applied to: 
#   - File uploads (the name of the uploaded file is translated)
#   - Zip-File uploads (all filenames in the Zip are translated)

# Folder translation can be used to maintain compatibility with older
# OpenCms installations, e.g. with version before the 5.0 (beta 2) release.
# This is done using Perl5 regular search & replace expression rules.
# All read and write access to a OpenCms VFS folder that matches one of given
# translation rules is automatically translated to the new name.
# Translation is stopped after the first match was found.
#
# The attribute "enabled" controls if folder translation is enabled.
# The default is "not enabled". Use this feature only if you have specific 
# reasons because it might hurt performance.
