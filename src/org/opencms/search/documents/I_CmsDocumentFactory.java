 * Used to create index Lucene Documents for OpenCms resources,

 *
 * The configuration of the search index is defined in <code>opencms-search.xml</code>.
 * There you can associate a combintion of OpenCms resource types and MIME types to an instance
 * of this factory. This rather complex configuration is required because only the combination of
 * OpenCms resource type and MIME type can decide what to use for search indexing.
 * For example, if the OpenCms resource type is <code>plain</code>,
 * the extraction algorithm for MIME types <code>.html</code> and <code>.txt</code> must be different.
 * On the other hand, the MIME type <code>.html</code> in OpenCms can be almost any resource type,
 * like <code>xmlpage</code>, <code>xmlcontent</code> or even <code>jsp</code>.<p>
