Package contains all classes and interfaces needed to create or use a repository to
access the resources in the VFS.<p>

A repository is an set of interfaces (and their implementations) to create a simple
access to the resources in the VFS of OpenCms. The repositories are configured in the
<code>opencms-importexport.xml</code>. The {@link org.opencms.file.wrapper.CmsObjectWrapper} 
is used by the repositories for the access to the VFS. So it is possible to configure 
the repositories to use one or more implementations of the 
{@link org.opencms.file.wrapper.I_CmsResourceWrapper} to change the view to the resources
in the VFS. Additionaly it is possible to define filters to include or exclude files and
folders form being displayed.<p>

Use the {@link org.opencms.repository.CmsRepositoryManager} to get a configured 
{@link org.opencms.repository.I_CmsRepository}. There you get a
{@link org.opencms.repository.I_CmsRepositorySession} through login in. With that session 
you will get the basic file and folder operations to the resources in the VFS of OpenCms.<p>

Example:<br/>
<code>
	I_CmsRepository repository = OpenCms.getRepositoryManager().getRepository(repository_name);<br/>
	I_CmsRepositorySession session = repository.login(username, password);
</code><p>
