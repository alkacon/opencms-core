## Compatibility

OpenCms 17 is compatible with Java 21, 17, 11 and 8.

_Please note that OpenCms 17 will be the last major OpenCms release that keeps Java 8 compatibility. Future OpenCms Versions will require at least Java 11._

OpenCms 17 requires a Java Servlet 4.0 compatible web container. We have tested this release using Jetty and Tomcat. It works "out of the box" with Jetty 12 or Tomcat 9. Others have reported deploying OpenCms successfully on other web servlet containers like WildFly, GlassFish, WebLogic, WebSphere and Resin.

On the database side, we provide support for MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, DB2 and HSQLDB.
