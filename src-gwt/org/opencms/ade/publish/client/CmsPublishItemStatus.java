/**
 * This class encapsulates the possible states of a publish item.<p>
 * 
 * An item can be enabled or disabled (because of an error). If it is enabled,
 * it can change between the states "normal", "publish", and "remove", but if it is
 * disabled, it can only change between "normal" and "remove".<p>
 * 
 * The state will be changed depending on various signals which are passed as 
 * parameters to the handleSignal() method.<p>
 * 
 * If the item is enabled, the only possible state transitions are as follows:
 * 
 * publish to normal 
 * publish to remove
 * normal to publish
 * normal to remove
 * remove to normal
