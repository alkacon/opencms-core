<p>There are plants and flowers existing which are almost unknown because they are so rare or simply grow at pretty exotic places.</p>
<p>Here you can find a selection of these palnts and flowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>The Undumbara Flower</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undumbara flowers arise in an extraordinary way. So far, this uncommon flower was found on objects like Buddha statues, steelpipes, windows, leafs and clinkers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blooming Undumbara flowers were first seen in May 2005 in Korea. Ten of this flowers were found in the face of a Budhisattve statue in the Sumi Zen temple. From this time on, it was also found at other places. The number of sightings declined in teh year 2007. In June and July 2007, it appeared in different areas in Taiwan. The residents met at this places, because they regarded this flower as a &quot;good sign&quot;.</p>
<p>Detecting the Udumbara flower in his house surprised the artists Chen Guodong from Taipei pleasantly. He said the flower is whitish and formed as little bells with the smell of sandelwood. He called out:&quot;It is a wonder! They are so tiny, it is difficult to see them without a microscope, but their smell is all over the balkony.&quot;</p>

<h5>Wollemia nobilis- one of the most expensive plants</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wollemia nobilis is a plant first detected 1994 in Australia. Before, it was only known from four million years old fossils. Therefore it was considered as extincted.</p>
<p>The evergreen tree reaches up to 40 meters height. The wollemia nobilis is monocecious. Male and fermale cones grow at the same tree, whereas one cone is to find at the end of a sided bough. After the seed maturity not only the cones are bucked off, also the whole bough.</p>
<p>In October 2005, 292 layers were first auctioned by Sotheby's in Sydney. The auction generated proceeds of 1,5 million USD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lithops- living stones</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most bizarre plants are Lithops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The botanical name of this plant is derived from the greek substantive &bdquo;λίθος&ldquo; (lithos) für &bdquo;stone&ldquo; und &bdquo;ὅψις&ldquo; (opsis) für &bdquo;appearance&ldquo;.</p>
<p>It adverts to the similarity to the plant with the stones were it normally grows in between.</p>
