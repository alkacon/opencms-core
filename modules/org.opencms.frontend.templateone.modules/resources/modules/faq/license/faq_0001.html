        <content><![CDATA[OpenCms has a build in module API (which is in fact a Java
interface). All modules that use that API are in terms of the LGPL
"works that use the library" and therefore are not bound by the
LGPL license. 
<br />
<br />However, if additions or changes to the core system are made,
the result is a derivative work, and certain restrictions apply,
the most important being that the license used for the derivative
work must also be the LGPL. 
<br />
<br />So companies can develop their additions to OpenCms as a
module and choose any license they like. However, the OpenCms core
system and all enhancements or additions to it will stay Open
Source.
