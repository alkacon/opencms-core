<h2>Backward compatibility with version 7.0</h2>
<p>We recommend everyone who uses OpenCms to update to the 7.5 release.</p>
<p>OpenCms 7.5&nbsp; is fully backward compatible to all prior 7.0.x versions. Most templates and other OpenCms developed code from version 7 should work &quot;out of the box&quot; with version 7.5.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 7.5 has been written and tested using Java 1.5 / 1.6. We have tested only with SUNs version of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies to sun.* packages so it should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms works &quot;out of the box&quot; with Tomcat 5.5, which we recommend. Others have reported deploying OpenCms successfully on other servlet containers like JBoss, BEA, Websphere and Resin Professional. We appreciate any feedback regarding other servlet containers.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL 4.1, MySQL 5.x, Oracle 9.x and Oracle 10.x, as well as PostgreSQL 8.2.x and 7.4.x, MS SQL Server 2000 / 2003, DB2 9.1 and HSQLDB 1.8.0. The automatic update wizard for OpenCms 7 supports MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the following in mind: The CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 7.5 final releases are &quot;build_7_5_x&quot;, so the 7.5.0 release is tagged &quot;build_7_5_0&quot;. Development of maintenance releases is currently done in CVS HEAD.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>

<p>Thank you for using OpenCms and have fun with OpenCms 7.5 :-)</p>
