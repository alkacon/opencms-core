<h2>Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>We recommend everyone who uses OpenCms to update to the 8.0.1 release.</p>
<p>OpenCms 8.0.1 is fully backward compatible to all prior 7.x versions.  Templates and other OpenCms developed code from version 7.0 or 7.5  should work &quot;out of the box&quot; with version 8.0.1.</p>
<p><strong>Notice for users of Alkacon OCEE:</strong> OpenCms version 8.0 requires Alkacon OCEE version 3.0 or later. In case you want to update your OpenCms installation to 8.0, please make sure you update Alkacon OCEE to 3.0 or later first!</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 8.0 has been written and tested using Java 5 / 6. We have tested only with Oracles version (formerly SUNs version) of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies to sun.* packages so it should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms works &quot;out of the box&quot; with Tomcat 6.0, which we recommend. Others have reported deploying OpenCms successfully on other servlet containers like JBoss, BEA, Websphere, Glassfish and Resin Professional. We appreciate any feedback regarding other servlet containers.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 5.x, Oracle 9.x and Oracle 10.x, as well as PostgreSQL 8.2.x, MS SQL Server 2000 / 2003, DB2 9.1 and HSQLDB 1.8.0. The  automatic update wizard for OpenCms 8 supports MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and build tags</h2>
<p>We are currently migrating the OpenCms repository from CVS to Git.  The &quot;blessed&quot; Git repository will be made available from Github at <a href="%(link0)">github.com/alkacon/opencms-core</a>.</p>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from Git, please keep the following in mind: The tag numbers for all OpenCms 8.0 final releases  are &quot;build_8_0_x&quot;, so the 8.0.1 release is tagged &quot;build_8_0_1&quot;.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>Contributions to the OpenCms core development are most welcome. Please contact the core development team on the <a href="%(link1)">opencms-dev</a> mailing list in case you are interested in supporting the development of OpenCms.</p>
<p>Please use our Bugzilla to report bugs in this release: <a href="%(link2)">http://bugzilla.opencms.org/<br />
