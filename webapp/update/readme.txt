                                    WARNING:

                             UPDATE AT YOUR OWN RISK

The OpenCms update wizard and these instructions are distributed in the hope 
that they will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Alkacon Software does not guarantee that there will be no damage to your 
existing OpenCms installation when using this upgrade wizard.

IMPORTANT: Before using this upgrade wizard, make sure you have a full backup 
           of your OpenCms installation and database.

IMPORTANT: Alkacon OCEE versions less than 5 will not work with OpenCms 10.   

IMPORTANT: The updater is only compatible with the database engines MySQL, 
           Oracle and PostgreSQL.
           
IMPORTANT: This version of OpenCms requires at least Java 7.

IMPORTANT: The upgrade wizard will replace all VFS resources of the updated modules.
           If you made modifications to these modules, their changes will be lost.
           In this case export the changed module resources before starting the update.
           Hint: You can use the "Resource changed since" feature in the Database 
           Administration to export all the changes you have done after installing 
           OpenCms.

Follow the following steps to update from OpenCms 8.x and 9.x to @OPENCMS_VERSION@:


1. Shutdown your OpenCms servlet container

The OpenCms upgrade requires that you shut down OpenCms first. You can use the 
Broadcast message tool in the 'Administration' view to inform users before the 
server is shut down.


2. Extract the OpenCms upgrade file 'opencms-upgrade-to-@OPENCMS_VERSION_NUMBER@.zip' to 
   your web application directory

If you extracted the file to an external directory, copy the folders 'update'
and 'WEB-INF' to the OpenCms webapp directory. Be sure that the files 'opencms.tld'
and 'lib/opencms.jar' are replaced with the new version from the archive before you 
continue. Be also sure that after unpacking the tomcat user has write permissions on 
the whole web application directory.
Be also aware that the 'web.xml' might be overwritten.
The OpenCmsUrlServletFilter available since version 10.5.0 will be disabled by default. 
Edit the 'web.xml' to enable it.


3. Enable the upgrade wizard

To do so, set the property 
wizard.enabled=true
in the config file WEB-INF/config/opencms.properties.

4. Restart your OpenCms servlet container

OpenCms will not start because the wizard in enabled. 


5. Execute the OpenCms update wizard

Open the URL $SERVER_NAME/$CONTEXT_NAME/update/ in your Browser, e.g.

http://yourserver:8080/opencms/update/

The update wizard should appear, which looks very similar to the OpenCms setup
wizard. Make sure to read the instructions and the disclaimer on the start 
page. Then execute the wizard which guides you through the update process.

You will need the Admin password to continue with the upgrade.

When asked to select the modules to update you should definitely select all
org.opencms.ade.*, org.opencms.editors.*, org.opencms.gwt and org.opencms.workplace.* 
modules.
 


After you confirmed the module selection, you should see the status report of the 
module import. This report is also written to WEB-INF/logs/update.log. Check this 
file for errors and exceptions after installation. There should be no exceptions
caused by the upgrade if everything went as expected. Some exceptions may occur 
in case you have an advanced OpenCms installation with many customized classes.

The update wizard will also do a full rebuild of all your search indices, and 
purge the JSP repository.

The wizard will finish similar to the setup wizard. After the final confirmation,
the wizard will be locked again (in the opencms.properties file).



6. Update Solr configuration

During the update Solr will be disabled in the WEB-INF/config/opencms-search.xml.
To update Solr you must update the 'schema.xml and' the 'solrconfig.xml' manually.
The new default configuration files are located in the solr-update/ directory in 
the WEB-INF folder of your application. If you are using the default configuration
from the distribution, it is sufficient to replace the folder WEB-INF/solr/ with
the solr-update/ folder. Else if you have customized the Solr configuration you might
want to merge the 'schema.xml' and the 'solrconfig.xml' first. Note that these two files
are now located under solr/configsets/default/conf/ - up to OpenCms 10 it was solr/conf/.
Even if you only keep your old config files, move them to solr/configsets/default/conf/.

If you are updating from an earlier version than 8.5.0, always copy the whole solr-update/ 
folder to the solr/ folder instead. 

When you are done, enable Solr in the opencms-search.xml again (and restart the servlet
container).



7. Shutdown and restart your OpenCms servlet container

Note: to be sure all jsp files work correctly please delete the servlet containers
work directory (ie. ${TOMCAT_HOME}/work/Catalina/localhost/opencms/) and the 
OpenCms' jsp repository (ie. ${OPENCMS_HOME}/WEB-INF/jsp/)

You should now be able to log into the OpenCms workplace as before.



8. Rebuild search indexes

As the search libraries and configuration may have changed, it is necessary to rebuild all search indexes.
Log into OpenCms and navigate to Launchpad > Search Management and rebuild all indexes.
  


9. Convert model groups [only relevant when updating from 10.0.x]

The way model groups are stored has changed between OpenCms 10.0.x and 10.5.x. So if you are using model 
groups and are updating your system from version 10.0.x, you will need to convert them to the new format.

This requires the following steps:

- Open the explorer, switch to the root site / "system folder" and navigate to the folder /system/modules/org.opencms.ade.config/pages.
- Execute the JSP "updateModelGroups.jsp" in this folder
- In the form displayed by the JSP, fill out the "base path" and "base container name" fields (they are 
  described in the form itself) and hit the submit button.
