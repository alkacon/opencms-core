# Parameters for static export
#################################################################################

# if static export is disabled nothing is exported and the rules are not used.
# For the handeling of the link tags one standard rule is generated with the 
# url_prefix_http value. So you can still configure the servletpath.
staticexport.enabled=true

# the static export is controlled by the resource property export. It has 6 possible 
# values: true, false, dynamic, https, https_enabled and dynamic_https_enabled. 
# With the property staticexport.default.export you can decide whitch value is used if
# a resource and all parentfolders don't have the the property export set. 
# If your site shoud be exported except a few resources you set the default to true
# and add the export=dynamic property to the folder where the dynamic pages are. If 
# your site is mostly dynamic you set the default to dynamic and add the export= true
# property to the pics and the download folder. 
# Only the values 'true' and 'dynamic' are allowed.
staticexport.default.export=true

# the path where to save the exported pages. This path may be relative or absolute.
staticexport.path=export/

# Prefix variables. The export prefix defines where to find the static reources. 
# The http prefix defines the way to the dynamic resources in OpenCms. The https and 
# the servername are used only for ssl. (If you use ssl you have to set the values like:
# https://server.de/${WEB_APP_NAME}/opencms for the https prefix and http://server.de 
# for the servername)
# The String ${WEB_APP_NAME} will be replaced by the name of
# the webapplication. These variables can also be used in the rulesets.
url_prefix_export=/${WEB_APP_NAME}/export
url_prefix_http=/${WEB_APP_NAME}/opencms
url_prefix_https=
url_prefix_servername=

# the name of the ruleset used to replace links while exporting, in the online project, 
# in the offlineproject and for the name in the extern file system. There are two sets
# of rules. Depending of the staticexport.default.export parameter the linkrules.true or
# the linkrules.dynamic are used.
linkrules.true.export=exportrules
linkrules.true.online=exportrules
linkrules.true.offline=offlinerules
linkrules.true.extern=externrules
linkrules.dynamic.export=dynamic_exportrules
linkrules.dynamic.online=dynamic_exportrules
linkrules.dynamic.offline=dynamic_offlinerules
linkrules.dynamic.extern=dynamic_externrules

# the start rule used for extern and export (not for online and offline).
# (the rules are regular expressions in perl5 standard)
#exportfirstrule=s#.([^&\?]*)=([^&\?]*)#_$1$2#g
#
# The start rule feature is removed. Instead there is a new feature: While exporting
# if after the dynamic rueles nothing has changed the parameters of the link will be 
# decoded in the name. so "/index.html?newsid=27&size=100" is replaced by "/index_402.html"
# where 402 is the id of the link in the database. Further rules (after the dynamic ones) 
# will be processed with the new link.


# The rulesets for linkreplacement as comma seperated lists
# You can use the ${WEB_APP_NAME} variable for the webapplication name and the
# four prefix variables defined above (${url_prefix_export}, ${url_prefix_http},...).
# They will be replaced befor using the regular expression.
# In addition to this it is possible to define the place where the dynamic
# generated rules should be used instead of a rule use the expression 
# *dynamicRules* (including the *'s). OpenCms replaces this with the dynamic
# generated rules.
# There are two types of dynamic rules. The first one is generated with the 
# resourceproperty "exportname". For each resouce with this property a rule 
# will be generated that replaces the absolute path of this resource with the 
# value of the property. It is principally used to get nice short foldernames 
# on the disc.
# The second kind of dynamic rules are generated with the property "export".
# The possible values are explained below. 
#
# Possible values for the "export" property are:
#
# export=true
#   The marked resource is exported.
#   For the online project, all links that point to this resource are 
#   build according to the "linkrules.true.extern" (see above) ruleset.
#   All links found on the marked resource that have been 
#   marked with the <link/> tag are followed and also checked for export.
#   Example:
#      VFS =/index.html
#      RFS =${webapp_path}/opencms/export/index.html
#      Link=<a href="${url_prefix_export}/index.html"/>
#
# export=false
#   The marked resource is not exported.
#   For the online project, all links that point to this resource are 
#   build according to the "linkrules.true.online" (see above) ruleset.
#   Links on the marked resource that are marked with the <link/> tag are 
#   NOT followed and therefore not exported.
#   Example:
#      VFS =/index.html
#      RFS =(none)
#      Link=<a href="${url_prefix_http}/index.html"/>
#   
# export=dynamic
#   The marked resource is not exported.
#   For the online project, all links that point to this resource are 
#   build according to the "linkrules.dynamic.online" (see above) ruleset.
#   All links found on the marked resource that have been 
#   marked with the <link/> tag are followed and also checked for export.
#   Example:
#      VFS =/index.html
#      RFS =(none)
#      Link=<a href="${url_prefix_http}/index.html"/>
#
# Static exort and https:
#   If you intent to use https settings with the export, 
#   you must extend the ${url_prefix_http} to include the http protocol,
#   and also set the ${url_prefix_https} and the ${url_prefix_servername}.
#   In this case, all links will be absolute links that contain server name
#   and protocol (but see also the resource setting "export=https_enabled" 
#   explained below). 
#
# export=https
#   The marked resource is not exported, but treated as a https resource.
#   For the online project, all links that point to this resource are 
#   build according to the "linkrules.true.online" (see above) ruleset,
#   using the "url_prefix_https" Prefix. 
#   All access to this resource that is NOT using the https protocol 
#   is forbidden!
#   All links found on the marked resource that have been 
#   marked with the <link/> tag are followed and also checked for export.
#   Example:
#      VFS =/index.html
#      RFS =(none)
#      Link=<a href="${url_prefix_https}/index.html"/>
#
# export=https_enabled
#   The marked resource is not exported.
#   For the online project, all links that point to this resource are 
#   build according to the "linkrules.true.extern" (see above) ruleset.
#   No protocol will be used for the link, so that a browser that 
#   was in https mode will be staying in https, while a http request
#   will stay in http mode.
#   Use this parameter esp. for images to prevent the dreaded webbrowser warning
#   that tells you something like "The page you are about
#   to view uses secure and unsecure data".
#   All links found on the marked resource that have been 
#   marked with the <link/> tag are followed and also checked for export.
#   Example:
#      VFS =/index.html
#      RFS =(none)
#      Link=<a href="/${web_app_name}/${opencms_servlet_name}/index.html"/>
#   
# export=dynamic_https_enabled
#   The marked resource is not exported, but treated as a https resource.
#   This is like "export=dynamic" with the addition that the resource 
#   will only be delivered if the request is a https request,
#   Example:
#      VFS =/index.html
#      RFS =(none)
#      Link=<a href="${url_prefix_https}/index.html"/>
#
# The dynamic rules are only for export, online and extern rules. Don't use them in 
# the offlineruleset.
# The parameterreplacement is done in the dynamic rules. So it works together with
# the exportname rule. If you have a rule befor the dynamic rules that is triggered
# the parameterreplacement will not happen.

# execution is an issue.  Note that if all log channels (see below) are
# enabled, the log may become really big since each request may
# generate many Kb of log. Some log channels are mainly for debugging
# purposes and should be disabled in a production environment.
# Syntax: log=[true,false] (boolean)
# Default: true

# Set the name of the log file.  To avoid possible confusion about
# the location of this file, an absolute pathname is recommended.

# Default: NONE
# Note: if the file could not be opened, try using absolute paths.

# Enable the timestamp before the log message

# Syntax: log.dateFormat=(String)
# Default: [dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss:SSS zz]
log.dateFormat=[dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss]
 
# Since all the messages logged are processed by a thread running with
# minimum priority, it's of vital importance that this thread gets a chance
# to run once in a while. If it doesn't, the log queue overflow occurs,
# usually resulting in the OutOfMemoryError.
#
# To prevent this from happening, two parameters are used: log.queue.maxage
# and log.queue.maxsize. The former defines the maximum time for the logged
# message to stay in the queue, the latter defines maximum number of
# messages in the queue.
#
# If one of those conditions becomes true (age > maxage || size > maxsize),
# the log message stating that fact is generated and the log queue is
# flushed in the separate thread.
#
# If you ever see such a message, either your system doesn't live up to its
# expectations or you have a runaway loop (probably, but not necessarily,
# generating a lot of log messages).
