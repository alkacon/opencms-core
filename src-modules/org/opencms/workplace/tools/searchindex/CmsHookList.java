/**
 * A list intended for subclassing that triggers "listlet" operations that may
 * access a on a "peer" object
 * that is provided by a template method to implement in subclasses. <p>
 *
 * This is intended to react on modifications on <code>{@link java.util.List}</code> instances
 * performed by <code>{@link org.opencms.workplace.CmsWidgetDialogParameter}</code> instances
 * linked to them. Using normal list implementations makes it impossible to intervene in those
 * list modification by the widget technology.<p>
 *
 * "Listlet" operations are operations that are triggered upon modification of this
 * list. They are called "on&lt;methodName(&gt;[e]d(&lt;peerObject&gt;, &lt;argList&gt;)"
 * where &lt;methodName&gt; is the name of the original list operation that took place,
 * "[e]d" stands for the past (operation took place), &lt;peerObject&gt; is the
 * given class to perform reactions on (see constructors) and
 *   &lt;argList&gt; are the arguments of the original list method in that order. <p>
 *
 * Currently only the operations used by <code>{@link org.opencms.workplace.CmsWidgetDialog}</code>
 * (see implementation of <code>{@link org.opencms.workplace.CmsWidgetDialog#actionToggleElement()}</code>)
 * are supported and sufficient for this purpose. More general usability enforces extending
 * the pattern shown here. <p>
